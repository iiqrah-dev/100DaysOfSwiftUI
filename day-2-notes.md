  - Booleans
    - stores true or false
    - could use ! (not) or isAuthenticates.toggle() to switch between the two options
    
  - Working with Strings
    - Concatenation 
      - joining two or more strings together using `+`
      - wasteful way of adding more than two strings together, creates copies of substrings that are never used 
   - Interpolation
      - injecting custom data into strings at runtime using `\()`
