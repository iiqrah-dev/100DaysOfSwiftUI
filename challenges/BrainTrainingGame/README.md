### About the project: 

A brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.
- Each turn of the game the app randomly picks either rock, paper, or scissors and whether to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.

### Features:

- Uses Bool.random() for win/lose logic
