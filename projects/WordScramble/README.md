### About the project: 

A game app that chooses a random 8 letter word from a text file and lets the uses type words containing the letter of the picked word. I got the opportunity to learn about Lists, UITextChecker, Bundle and guarding against errors to provide useful messages.  

### Features:

- App has multiple checks to now allow used, unreal, short or random words
- Keeps a count of score depending on letter of word
- Functionality to start new game at any point
- Simple and clean UI
