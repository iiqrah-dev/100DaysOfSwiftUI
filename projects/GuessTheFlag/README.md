### About the project: 

A guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.
In this project I learnt about images, stacks, gradients, buttons, and more, along with a whole host of new modifiers to help bring UI designs to life.

### Features:

- Game restarts after 8 questions
- Constant update about score
- Correct answer revealed in the alert if wrong flag is tapped
