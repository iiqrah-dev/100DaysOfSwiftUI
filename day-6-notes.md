  ###
  
  - For Loop
    - can loop over:
      - items in an array `for name in names {print(" Name: \(name)")}`
        - - 1... : one sided range to start from 1 and go till the end, usually for arrays
      - fixed range of number `for i in 1...10 {print("\(i)")}` 
        - 1...12 : includes 12 in range
        - 1..<12 : excludes 12 in range
   - use `_` as loop variable if it is not being used inside the loop
   
 - While Loop
  - loops until a condition is true
  - used when we don'y know the exact times a loop needs to be carried out
  
- Continue/Break
